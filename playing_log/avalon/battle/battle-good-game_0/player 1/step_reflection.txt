the summary is <summary>Reveal Phase: In the current reveal phase, the Host instructed all players to close their eyes, which they did. Player 1 (Merlin) is aware of the identities of Morgana and the Assassin and plans to use this information strategically to prevent them from being selected as candidates for quests. The Host then instructed Morgana and the Assassin to open their eyes and confirm their teammates, followed by closing their eyes again.

Voting status and quest outcomes are not applicable at this point since the quest phase has not yet begun.</summary>
output:
In the reveal phase, Player 1 (Merlin) has identified Morgana and the Assassin. This knowledge is crucial for strategizing against the evil side. Since no roles have been claimed yet, Player 1 should remain vigilant and prepare to challenge any potential candidates for quests that may include Morgana or the Assassin. The absence of discussions indicates that players are likely assessing their strategies, making it essential for Player 1 to leverage their knowledge effectively once the quest phase begins.
