Player 2 has not exhibited any suspicious behavior during the reveal phase. They have followed the instructions of the moderator and have not shown any knowledge of the evil players. It is likely that Player 2 is a Loyal Servant.

Player 3 has been identified as Morgana during the reveal phase. As Morgana, they are aware of the identity of the Assassin (Player 6). Player 1, as Merlin, should be cautious of Player 3's actions during the quest phase, as Morgana can deceive Percival (if present) into believing they are Merlin. Player 1 should try to prevent Player 3 from being selected as a candidate for quests.

- No discussions about quest candidates or voting status have occurred yet, as the game is still in the reveal phase. The task has not yet succeeded or failed, as the quest phase has not started.</summary>
the analysis about other players is <analysis>As Player 1 (Merlin), I have identified Player 2 (Morgana) and Player 3 (Assassin) as the evil roles. My strategy will focus on preventing them from being selected as candidates for quests, as their involvement could jeopardize the success of our side. The reveal phase has confirmed my role, and I must remain vigilant in the upcoming discussions to protect the good side's interests. With no prior discussions on candidates, I will prepare to advocate strongly against any proposals involving Morgana or the Assassin.</analysis>

the summary of previous turns <summary>Reveal Phase: During the reveal phase, all players were instructed to close their eyes, and the Host facilitated the reveal of roles. Morgana and the Assassin confirmed their identities to each other, while Merlin and Percival were also given the opportunity to identify their counterparts. As a Loyal Servant, I remained passive and did not reveal any information. No claims of roles or opinions about quest candidates were made during this phase, as it was focused on the reveal of roles. There has been no discussion about quest candidates or voting status, and no tasks have been attempted yet, so the status of any quests is not applicable at this time.</summary>
the analysis about other players is <analysis>During the reveal phase, players confirmed their roles without revealing additional information. Morgana and the Assassin are likely coordinating, while Merlin and Percival are aware of each other, which may influence their future decisions. As a Loyal Servant, my passive stance means I lack specific insights into the dynamics between the good and evil sides. The absence of claims or discussions about quest candidates indicates a cautious approach, suggesting that players are still assessing their positions and alliances before engaging in the quest phase.</analysis>
