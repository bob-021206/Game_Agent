output:Summary: In the current reveal phase, the Host instructed all players to close their eyes, which they complied with. As Merlin, I (Player 1) am aware of the identities of Morgana and the Assassin, which I will use to guide my actions in the upcoming quest phase. The Host then instructed Morgana and the Assassin to open their eyes and confirm their identities as teammates, followed by another instruction for them to close their eyes again. There are no claims of roles or discussions about quest candidates or voting status yet, as the phase is still in the reveal stage. The task status (success or failure) is not applicable at this point since no quest has occurred yet.

output:Summary: During the reveal phase, all players were instructed to close their eyes, and the Host facilitated the reveal process for Morgana, Assassin, and Merlin. Player 1 (Loyal Servant) remained passive and observed without revealing any information. The Host confirmed the actions of Morgana and Assassin, allowing them to identify each other, and then instructed Merlin to open their eyes and confirm their identity. No roles were claimed publicly, and no discussions about quest candidates or voting statuses occurred during this phase. The task of the reveal phase was not applicable, as it was focused on identifying roles rather than engaging in a quest.
