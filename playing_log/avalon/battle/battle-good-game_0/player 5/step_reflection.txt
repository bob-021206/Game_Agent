the summary is <summary>Reveal Phase: In the current reveal phase, the Host instructed all players to close their eyes, followed by specific instructions for Morgana and the Assassin to open their eyes and confirm their identities. After that, the Host guided Merlin to open their eyes and identify Morgana and the Assassin by raising their hands. The phase has not yet progressed to the quest phase, so there are no claims of roles, opinions on quest candidates, voting statuses, or outcomes of tasks to summarize at this time.</summary>
output:
As Player 5 (Percival), I have not yet gathered any behavioral information from other players since the reveal phase is still ongoing. The only insights I have are that Morgana and the Assassin are aware of each other, while Merlin has identified them. My strategy will focus on protecting Merlin and ensuring that any suspected evil players are not included in quest candidates once the quest phase begins. I will remain vigilant for any signs of deception or alignment as the game progresses.

output:
As Player 5 (Merlin), I recognize that Player 4 (Morgana) is attempting to manipulate the quest by proposing Player 6 (Assassin) and Player 1 as candidates.
