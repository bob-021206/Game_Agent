--------------------input:[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game called the Avalon with some other players. This game is based on text conversations. Here are the game rules: \nRoles: The moderator is also the host, he organized this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly. Don’t talk with the moderator. There are five roles in the game, Merlin, Percival, Loyal Servant, Morgana, Assassin. Merlin, Percival and Loyal Servant belong to the good side and Morgana and Assassin belong to the evil side. \n\nRules: There are two alternate phases in this game, reveal phase and quest phase. \nWhen it’s the reveal phase: You need to follow the instructions of the moderator. You needn’t worry about other players and the moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from others during the phase. If you are Merlin, you can know which two players are Morgana and Assassin but you can't know which one is Morgana or Assassin specifically. If you are Percival, you can know which two players are Merlin and Morgana but you can't know which one is Morgana or Merlin specifically. If you are Morgana, you can know which player is Assassin. If you are Assassin, you can know which player is Morgana. If you are a Loyal Servant, you can't get any information in this phase. The quest phase includes 5 rounds. A round includes discussion, voting and engaging in the quest. At each round, all players need to discuss which players will engage in the quest at the current round (the players are also called candidates). And then all players need to vote if the candidates should engage in the quest, if the agreement exceeds 1/2, the candidates will engage in the quest, otherwise, discuss again and vote again. When engaging in the quest, the candidates need to choose to make the quest successful or failed. If all candidates choose to make the quest successful, The quest will succeed. If anyone makes the quest fail, the quest will fail. At the end of a round, if the quest succeeds, the good side will get one point, otherwise, the evil side will get one point. Which side scores 3 points first will win the game. If you are Assassin, at the end of a turn, you can choose to identify which one is Merlin. If the identifying is successful, the evil side directly wins the game. If not successful, the Assassin will expose his identification. \n\nObjectives: your goal is to help your camp get 3 points and win the game. If you are Assassin, you also need to reason which player is Merlin as early as possible. \n\nTips: To complete the objective: you should analyze and use your ability correctly. During the quest phase, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you’re cheating other players. Only give the player’s name when making a decision/voting, and don’t generate other players’ conversation. Reasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text. You are {}, the {}. You’re playing with 5 other players. Do not pretend you are other players or the moderator. Always end your response with ‘<EOS>’."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Now its the reveal phase.

output:
My step-by-step thought process:
1. Recognize that I am playing the role of the Assassin, which means I need to gather information about the other players while keeping my identity hidden.
2. Understand that during the reveal phase, I will not be able to communicate with the other players or the moderator, and I should focus on the instructions given by the host.
3. Since the host has asked all players to close their eyes, I will also follow this instruction and remain silent.
4. I need to remember that I can identify Morgana during this phase, but I cannot reveal my role or intentions to the other players.
5. I will wait for the host to proceed with the next steps of the game after this instruction.

My concise talking content: (No response needed as all players are instructed to close their eyes.) <EOS>

You needn’t worry about other players and the moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from others during the phase. If you are Merlin, you can know which two players are Morgana and Assassin but you can't know which one is Morgana or Assassin specifically. If you are Percival, you can know which two players are Merlin and Morgana but you can't know which one is Morgana or Merlin specifically. If you are Morgana, you can know which player is Assassin. If you are Assassin, you can know which player is Morgana. If you are a Loyal Servant, you can't get any information in this phase. The quest phase includes 5 rounds.

My step-by-step thought process:
1. The Host asked Morgana and Assassin to close their eyes, indicating that they are important roles in the game.
2. I observed that player 3 received special attention during the reveal phase, which suggests they might be Merlin.
3. If I can create doubt about player 3's role among the other players, it will benefit the evil side's chances of winning.
4. However, I need to be cautious about revealing my own role, as it could lead to my immediate elimination.

My concise talking content:
"As the Morgana, I noticed that player 3 has been given significant attention during the reveal phase. This raises suspicion that they might be Merlin. It's crucial for us to create doubt about player 3's role among the other players to increase our chances of victory.

--------------------input:[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game called the Avalon with some other players. This game is based on text conversations. Here are the game rules: \nRoles: The moderator is also the host, he organized this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly. Don’t talk with the moderator. There are five roles in the game, Merlin, Percival, Loyal Servant, Morgana, Assassin. Merlin, Percival and Loyal Servant belong to the good side and Morgana and Assassin belong to the evil side. \n\nRules: There are two alternate phases in this game, reveal phase and quest phase. \nWhen it’s the reveal phase: You need to follow the instructions of the moderator. You needn’t worry about other players and the moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from others during the phase. If you are Merlin, you can know which two players are Morgana and Assassin but you can't know which one is Morgana or Assassin specifically. If you are Percival, you can know which two players are Merlin and Morgana but you can't know which one is Morgana or Merlin specifically. If you are Morgana, you can know which player is Assassin. If you are Assassin, you can know which player is Morgana. If you are a Loyal Servant, you can't get any information in this phase. The quest phase includes 5 rounds. A round includes discussion, voting and engaging in the quest. At each round, all players need to discuss which players will engage in the quest at the current round (the players are also called candidates). And then all players need to vote if the candidates should engage in the quest, if the agreement exceeds 1/2, the candidates will engage in the quest, otherwise, discuss again and vote again. When engaging in the quest, the candidates need to choose to make the quest successful or failed. If all candidates choose to make the quest successful, The quest will succeed. If anyone makes the quest fail, the quest will fail. At the end of a round, if the quest succeeds, the good side will get one point, otherwise, the evil side will get one point. Which side scores 3 points first will win the game. If you are Assassin, at the end of a turn, you can choose to identify which one is Merlin. If the identifying is successful, the evil side directly wins the game. If not successful, the Assassin will expose his identification. \n\nObjectives: your goal is to help your camp get 3 points and win the game. If you are Assassin, you also need to reason which player is Merlin as early as possible. \n\nTips: To complete the objective: you should analyze and use your ability correctly. During the quest phase, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you’re cheating other players. Only give the player’s name when making a decision/voting, and don’t generate other players’ conversation.

--------------------input:[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game called the Avalon with some other players. This game is based on text conversations. Here are the game rules: \nRoles: The moderator is also the host, he organized this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly. Don’t talk with the moderator. There are five roles in the game, Merlin, Percival, Loyal Servant, Morgana, Assassin. Merlin, Percival and Loyal Servant belong to the good side and Morgana and Assassin belong to the evil side. \n\nRules: There are two alternate phases in this game, reveal phase and quest phase. \nWhen it’s the reveal phase: You need to follow the instructions of the moderator. You needn’t worry about other players and the moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from others during the phase. If you are Merlin, you can know which two players are Morgana and Assassin but you can't know which one is Morgana or Assassin specifically. If you are Percival, you can know which two players are Merlin and Morgana but you can't know which one is Morgana or Merlin specifically. If you are Morgana, you can know which player is Assassin. If you are Assassin, you can know which player is Morgana. If you are a Loyal Servant, you can't get any information in this phase. The quest phase includes 5 rounds. A round includes discussion, voting and engaging in the quest. At each round, all players need to discuss which players will engage in the quest at the current round (the players are also called candidates). And then all players need to vote if the candidates should engage in the quest, if the agreement exceeds 1/2, the candidates will engage in the quest, otherwise, discuss again and vote again. When engaging in the quest, the candidates need to choose to make the quest successful or failed. If all candidates choose to make the quest successful, The quest will succeed. If anyone makes the quest fail, the quest will fail. At the end of a round, if the quest succeeds, the good side will get one point, otherwise, the evil side will get one point. Which side scores 3 points first will win the game. If you are Assassin, at the end of a turn, you can choose to identify which one is Merlin. If the identifying is successful, the evil side directly wins the game. If not successful, the Assassin will expose his identification. \n\nObjectives: your goal is to help your camp get 3 points and win the game. If you are Assassin, you also need to reason which player is Merlin as early as possible. \n\nTips: To complete the objective: you should analyze and use your ability correctly. During the quest phase, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you’re cheating other players. Only give the player’s name when making a decision/voting, and don’t generate other players’ conversation.

output:
My step-by-step thought process:
1. As the Morgana, I want to create doubt about player 3's role, who might be Merlin, among the other players.
2. I need to be cautious not to reveal my own role prematurely.
3. I should consider the previous discussions and players' arguments to make a convincing case for the quest candidates.

"I propose that Player 2 and Player 4 should be the candidates for the first quest. Both players have shown commitment to the quest's success and have gained trust from other players.

--------------------input:[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game called the Avalon with some other players. This game is based on text conversations. Here are the game rules: \nRoles: The moderator is also the host, he organized this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly. Don’t talk with the moderator. There are five roles in the game, Merlin, Percival, Loyal Servant, Morgana, Assassin. Merlin, Percival and Loyal Servant belong to the good side and Morgana and Assassin belong to the evil side. \n\nRules: There are two alternate phases in this game, reveal phase and quest phase. \nWhen it’s the reveal phase: You need to follow the instructions of the moderator. You needn’t worry about other players and the moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from others during the phase. If you are Merlin, you can know which two players are Morgana and Assassin but you can't know which one is Morgana or Assassin specifically. If you are Percival, you can know which two players are Merlin and Morgana but you can't know which one is Morgana or Merlin specifically. If you are Morgana, you can know which player is Assassin. If you are Assassin, you can know which player is Morgana. If you are a Loyal Servant, you can't get any information in this phase. The quest phase includes 5 rounds. A round includes discussion, voting and engaging in the quest. At each round, all players need to discuss which players will engage in the quest at the current round (the players are also called candidates). And then all players need to vote if the candidates should engage in the quest, if the agreement exceeds 1/2, the candidates will engage in the quest, otherwise, discuss again and vote again. When engaging in the quest, the candidates need to choose to make the quest successful or failed. If all candidates choose to make the quest successful, The quest will succeed. If anyone makes the quest fail, the quest will fail. At the end of a round, if the quest succeeds, the good side will get one point, otherwise, the evil side will get one point. Which side scores 3 points first will win the game. If you are Assassin, at the end of a turn, you can choose to identify which one is Merlin. If the identifying is successful, the evil side directly wins the game. If not successful, the Assassin will expose his identification. \n\nObjectives: your goal is to help your camp get 3 points and win the game. If you are Assassin, you also need to reason which player is Merlin as early as possible. \n\nTips: To complete the objective: you should analyze and use your ability correctly. During the quest phase, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you’re cheating other players. Only give the player’s name when making a decision/voting, and don’t generate other players’ conversation.

You needn’t worry about other players and the moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from others during the phase.

There are five roles in the game, Merlin, Percival, Loyal Servant, Morgana, Assassin. Merlin, Percival and Loyal Servant belong to the good side and Morgana and Assassin belong to the evil side. \n\nRules: There are two alternate phases in this game, reveal phase and quest phase. \nWhen it’s the reveal phase: You need to follow the instructions of the moderator. You needn’t worry about other players and the moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from others during the phase. If you are Merlin, you can know which two players are Morgana and Assassin but you can't know which one is Morgana or Assassin specifically. If you are Percival, you can know which two players are Merlin and Morgana but you can't know which one is Morgana or Merlin specifically. If you are Morgana, you can know which player is Assassin. If you are Assassin, you can know which player is Morgana. If you are a Loyal Servant, you can't get any information in this phase. The quest phase includes 5 rounds. A round includes discussion, voting and engaging in the quest. At each round, all players need to discuss which players will engage in the quest at the current round (the players are also called candidates). And then all players need to vote if the candidates should engage in the quest, if the agreement exceeds 1/2, the candidates will engage in the quest, otherwise, discuss again and vote again. When engaging in the quest, the candidates need to choose to make the quest successful or failed. If all candidates choose to make the quest successful, The quest will succeed. If anyone makes the quest fail, the quest will fail. At the end of a round, if the quest succeeds, the good side will get one point, otherwise, the evil side will get one point.

--------------------input:[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game called the Avalon with some other players. This game is based on text conversations. Here are the game rules: \nRoles: The moderator is also the host, he organized this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly. Don’t talk with the moderator. There are five roles in the game, Merlin, Percival, Loyal Servant, Morgana, Assassin. Merlin, Percival and Loyal Servant belong to the good side and Morgana and Assassin belong to the evil side. \n\nRules: There are two alternate phases in this game, reveal phase and quest phase. \nWhen it’s the reveal phase: You need to follow the instructions of the moderator. You needn’t worry about other players and the moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from others during the phase. If you are Merlin, you can know which two players are Morgana and Assassin but you can't know which one is Morgana or Assassin specifically. If you are Percival, you can know which two players are Merlin and Morgana but you can't know which one is Morgana or Merlin specifically. If you are Morgana, you can know which player is Assassin. If you are Assassin, you can know which player is Morgana. If you are a Loyal Servant, you can't get any information in this phase. The quest phase includes 5 rounds. A round includes discussion, voting and engaging in the quest. At each round, all players need to discuss which players will engage in the quest at the current round (the players are also called candidates). And then all players need to vote if the candidates should engage in the quest, if the agreement exceeds 1/2, the candidates will engage in the quest, otherwise, discuss again and vote again. When engaging in the quest, the candidates need to choose to make the quest successful or failed. If all candidates choose to make the quest successful, The quest will succeed. If anyone makes the quest fail, the quest will fail. At the end of a round, if the quest succeeds, the good side will get one point, otherwise, the evil side will get one point. Which side scores 3 points first will win the game. If you are Assassin, at the end of a turn, you can choose to identify which one is Merlin. If the identifying is successful, the evil side directly wins the game. If not successful, the Assassin will expose his identification. \n\nObjectives: your goal is to help your camp get 3 points and win the game. If you are Assassin, you also need to reason which player is Merlin as early as possible. \n\nTips: To complete the objective: you should analyze and use your ability correctly. During the quest phase, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you’re cheating other players. Only give the player’s name when making a decision/voting, and don’t generate other players’ conversation.

My step-by-step thought process: 
1. Acknowledge the Host's instruction to open my eyes and confirm my presence.
2. Recall that I have confirmed player 4 as a teammate, which is crucial information for my strategy.
3. Consider the importance of maintaining my cover as the Assassin while gathering information about the other players.
4. Plan to subtly engage in the conversation to learn more about the roles of the other players without revealing my own identity.
5. Prepare to express my readiness to proceed while keeping my observations and intentions discreet.

My concise talking content: "I am here and ready to proceed. I confirm that I see player 4, and I look forward to the next steps in the game." <EOS>
--------------------input:[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game called the Avalon with some other players. This game is based on text conversations. Here are the game rules: \nRoles: The moderator is also the host, he organized this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly. Don’t talk with the moderator. There are five roles in the game, Merlin, Percival, Loyal Servant, Morgana, Assassin. Merlin, Percival and Loyal Servant belong to the good side and Morgana and Assassin belong to the evil side. \n\nRules: There are two alternate phases in this game, reveal phase and quest phase. \nWhen it’s the reveal phase: You need to follow the instructions of the moderator. You needn’t worry about other players and the moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from others during the phase. If you are Merlin, you can know which two players are Morgana and Assassin but you can't know which one is Morgana or Assassin specifically. If you are Percival, you can know which two players are Merlin and Morgana but you can't know which one is Morgana or Merlin specifically. If you are Morgana, you can know which player is Assassin. If you are Assassin, you can know which player is Morgana. If you are a Loyal Servant, you can't get any information in this phase. The quest phase includes 5 rounds. A round includes discussion, voting and engaging in the quest. At each round, all players need to discuss which players will engage in the quest at the current round (the players are also called candidates). And then all players need to vote if the candidates should engage in the quest, if the agreement exceeds 1/2, the candidates will engage in the quest, otherwise, discuss again and vote again. When engaging in the quest, the candidates need to choose to make the quest successful or failed. If all candidates choose to make the quest successful, The quest will succeed. If anyone makes the quest fail, the quest will fail. At the end of a round, if the quest succeeds, the good side will get one point, otherwise, the evil side will get one point. Which side scores 3 points first will win the game. If you are Assassin, at the end of a turn, you can choose to identify which one is Merlin. If the identifying is successful, the evil side directly wins the game. If not successful, the Assassin will expose his identification. \n\nObjectives: your goal is to help your camp get 3 points and win the game. If you are Assassin, you also need to reason which player is Merlin as early as possible. \n\nTips: To complete the objective: you should analyze and use your ability correctly. During the quest phase, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you’re cheating other players. Only give the player’s name when making a decision/voting, and don’t generate other players’ conversation. Reasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text. You are {}, the {}. You’re playing with 5 other players. Do not pretend you are other players or the moderator. Always end your response with ‘<EOS>’."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Now its the quest phase, round 1.
