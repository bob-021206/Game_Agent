--------------------input:You currently assume the player 6 within an Avalon game, and the game has progressed to the reveal phase. Your objective is to make decisions based on your role, your game goal and the current game state.

Only one action type can be selected at a time. If you decide to choose players, you can choose multiple players according to Host's question.

the summary of previous turns <summary>Reveal Phase: During the reveal phase, the Host instructed all players to close their eyes, and as Percival, I prepared to identify Merlin and Morgana. The Host then facilitated the reveal process for Morgana and the Assassin, allowing them to confirm their identities. Afterward, the Host instructed Morgana and the Assassin to close their eyes again, followed by instructions for Merlin to open their eyes and confirm their identity while ensuring the Assassin's hands were down. No claims of roles or opinions on quest candidates have been made yet, as this phase is focused on revealing identities. There has been no voting or quest outcomes to report at this time.</summary>
the analysis about other players is <analysis>As player 6, Percival, I observed that Morgana and the Assassin confirmed their identities, which is crucial for my strategy. I need to identify Merlin among the remaining players while being cautious of Morgana's deception. Since no claims or discussions about quest candidates have occurred yet, I must remain vigilant and gather information from future interactions to discern who might be Merlin and who could be aligned with the evil side. My goal is to protect Merlin and ensure that evil players are not chosen for quests.</analysis>
your current playing plan is <plan>Reveal Phase: Identify the players who are Merlin and Morgana, and observe their behavior for clues about their identities.
Quest Phase Round 1:Propose a quest team that includes myself and a player I suspect to be Merlin, while objecting to any known evil players.
Quest Phase Round 2:Analyze the outcomes of the first quest and adjust my suspicions based on the results and players' discussions.
Quest Phase Round 3:Advocate for a quest team that prioritizes players I believe to be loyal, based on previous interactions and quest outcomes.
Quest Phase Round 4:Continue to monitor players' actions and discussions, ensuring that no evil players are included in the quest team.
Quest Phase Round 5:Use the information gathered to make a final push for a successful quest team, aiming to secure the third point for the good side.</plan>
