the summary is <summary>Reveal Phase: During the reveal phase, the Host instructed all players to close their eyes, and as Percival, I prepared to identify Merlin and Morgana. The Host then facilitated the reveal process for Morgana and the Assassin, allowing them to confirm their identities. Afterward, the Host instructed Morgana and the Assassin to close their eyes again, followed by instructions for Merlin to open their eyes and confirm their identity while ensuring the Assassin's hands were down. No claims of roles or opinions on quest candidates have been made yet, as this phase is focused on revealing identities. There has been no voting or quest outcomes to report at this time.</summary>
output:
As player 6, Percival, I observed that Morgana and the Assassin confirmed their identities, which is crucial for my strategy. I need to identify Merlin among the remaining players while being cautious of Morgana's deception. Since no claims or discussions about quest candidates have occurred yet, I must remain vigilant and gather information from future interactions to discern who might be Merlin and who could be aligned with the evil side. My goal is to protect Merlin and ensure that evil players are not chosen for quests.
