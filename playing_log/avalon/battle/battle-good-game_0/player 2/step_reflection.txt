the summary is <summary>Reveal Phase: In the current reveal phase, the Host has conducted a series of instructions for the players to identify their roles. Player 2 (Loyal Servant) has not received any specific information about other players' roles, as they are not privy to that information. The Host has instructed Morgana and the Assassin to open their eyes and confirm their teammates, followed by closing their eyes again. Merlin was then instructed to open their eyes and see Morgana and the Assassin, and subsequently close their eyes. Finally, Percival was instructed to open their eyes and see Merlin and Morgana before closing their eyes again. No claims of roles or opinions about quest candidates have been made yet, and there has been no voting or quest outcomes to report at this stage.</summary>
output:
In the reveal phase, Player 2 (Loyal Servant) lacks information about other players' roles, limiting their strategic insight. The behaviors observed indicate that Morgana and the Assassin are aware of each other, while Merlin knows both evil roles but cannot identify them specifically. Percival has knowledge of Merlin and Morgana, which may influence future discussions. As a Loyal Servant, Player 2 should focus on supporting candidates for quests without revealing their role, aiming to build trust and facilitate successful quests to help the good side win.
