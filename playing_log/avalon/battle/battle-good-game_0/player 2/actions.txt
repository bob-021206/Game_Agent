Player 2 (Loyal Servant) has not received any specific information about other players' roles, as they are not privy to that information. The Host has instructed Morgana and the Assassin to open their eyes and confirm their teammates, followed by closing their eyes again. Merlin was then instructed to open their eyes and see Morgana and the Assassin, and subsequently close their eyes. Finally, Percival was instructed to open their eyes and see Merlin and Morgana before closing their eyes again. No claims of roles or opinions about quest candidates have been made yet, and there has been no voting or quest outcomes to report at this stage.</summary>
the analysis about other players is <analysis>In the reveal phase, Player 2 (Loyal Servant) lacks information about other players' roles, limiting their strategic insight. The behaviors observed indicate that Morgana and the Assassin are aware of each other, while Merlin knows both evil roles but cannot identify them specifically. Percival has knowledge of Merlin and Morgana, which may influence future discussions. As a Loyal Servant, Player 2 should focus on supporting candidates for quests without revealing their role, aiming to build trust and facilitate successful quests to help the good side win.</analysis>

Quest Phase Turn 1:In the current reveal phase of the Avalon game, the following conversations have taken place regarding the candidates for the first quest:

- **Player Roles**: Player 3 is identified as Morgana, and Player 6 is identified as the Assassin by Player 1, who is aware of their identities.
- **Proposed Candidates**: Player 1 proposed Player 2 and Player 4 as candidates for the quest, citing their trustworthiness. Player 3 also supports Player 4 and themselves as candidates, while Player 4 and Player 5 agree on Player 2 and Player 4. Player 6 echoes the support for Player 2 and Player 4.
- **Player 2's Position**: As Player 2 (Loyal Servant), I believe Player 4 and I should be the candidates, emphasizing the importance of excluding players from the evil side to ensure success.
- **Voting Status**: All players have expressed support for the candidates Player 2 and Player 4, indicating a consensus towards their inclusion in the quest.
- **Quest Outcome**: The quest has not yet occurred, so the success or failure of the task is still to be determined.

Player 2's strategy of self-nomination aligns with the goal of ensuring a successful quest. Observing the dynamics, it’s crucial to remain vigilant about Player 3 and Player 6's potential influence on the quest's outcome.</analysis>

After that, the moderator asked Morgana and Assassin to raise their hands and then instructed Merlin to open his eyes and Morgana and Assassin to raise their hands. Percival was then instructed to open his eyes and Merlin and Morgana were asked to raise their hands. Finally, all players were instructed to open their eyes. As player 2, the Loyal Servant, I did not receive any information about other players' roles during this phase and will remain observant and passive until the quest phase begins.

the Host's question is <question>As the players who engage in the quest in this turn, you can choose to succeed or fail the quest. If all players engaging in the quest choose the quest to succeed, the good side will get one point. If any player chooses the quest to fail, the evil side will get one point. Please choose.</question>

the summary of previous turns <summary>Reveal Phase: In the current reveal phase, the Host instructed all players to close their eyes, which was acknowledged by player 2 (Percival) in a private message. The Host then facilitated the Morgana and Assassin's confirmation of their roles, followed by their instructions to close their eyes again. The Host also guided Merlin through the process of opening and closing their eyes while confirming the presence of Morgana and the Assassin. No players have claimed their roles publicly yet, and there has been no discussion regarding quest candidates or voting status, as the phase is still focused on role revelation. The task of identifying roles has not yet succeeded or failed, as the quest phase has not commenced.</summary>
the analysis about other players is <analysis>As Percival, I have not yet gathered enough information to identify any players definitively. The reveal phase has focused on confirming roles without public claims or discussions. I need to observe behaviors in the upcoming quest phase to discern potential evil players. My strategy will involve closely monitoring interactions and voting patterns to protect Merlin and ensure that candidates for quests are trustworthy. Until players reveal more about their roles, I must remain cautious and attentive to any signs of deception.</analysis>

Quest Phase Round 3:I will push for a quest team that includes players I have reason to believe are loyal, based on their previous actions.
