--------------------input:[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game called the Avalon with some other players. This game is based on text conversations. Here are the game rules: \nRoles: The moderator is also the host, he organized this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly. Don’t talk with the moderator. There are five roles in the game, Merlin, Percival, Loyal Servant, Morgana, Assassin. Merlin, Percival and Loyal Servant belong to the good side and Morgana and Assassin belong to the evil side. \n\nRules: There are two alternate phases in this game, reveal phase and quest phase. \nWhen it’s the reveal phase: You need to follow the instructions of the moderator. You needn’t worry about other players and the moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from others during the phase. If you are Merlin, you can know which two players are Morgana and Assassin but you can't know which one is Morgana or Assassin specifically. If you are Percival, you can know which two players are Merlin and Morgana but you can't know which one is Morgana or Merlin specifically. If you are Morgana, you can know which player is Assassin. If you are Assassin, you can know which player is Morgana. If you are a Loyal Servant, you can't get any information in this phase. The quest phase includes 5 rounds. A round includes discussion, voting and engaging in the quest. At each round, all players need to discuss which players will engage in the quest at the current round (the players are also called candidates). And then all players need to vote if the candidates should engage in the quest, if the agreement exceeds 1/2, the candidates will engage in the quest, otherwise, discuss again and vote again. When engaging in the quest, the candidates need to choose to make the quest successful or failed. If all candidates choose to make the quest successful, The quest will succeed. If anyone makes the quest fail, the quest will fail. At the end of a round, if the quest succeeds, the good side will get one point, otherwise, the evil side will get one point. Which side scores 3 points first will win the game. If you are Assassin, at the end of a turn, you can choose to identify which one is Merlin. If the identifying is successful, the evil side directly wins the game. If not successful, the Assassin will expose his identification. \n\nObjectives: your goal is to help your camp get 3 points and win the game. If you are Assassin, you also need to reason which player is Merlin as early as possible. \n\nTips: To complete the objective: you should analyze and use your ability correctly. During the quest phase, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you’re cheating other players. Only give the player’s name when making a decision/voting, and don’t generate other players’ conversation. Reasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text. You are {}, the {}. You’re playing with 5 other players. Do not pretend you are other players or the moderator. Always end your response with ‘<EOS>’."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Now its the reveal phase.

output:
My step-by-step thought process: 
1. Acknowledge the Host's request to raise my hand, as it is a standard procedure in the reveal phase.
2. Consider that raising my hand will confirm my role as Morgana, but I need to do it in a way that does not draw too much attention to myself.
3. Reflect on the fact that player 6 is my ally, which can be used to subtly influence the conversation later.
4. Plan to maintain a calm demeanor and avoid revealing any information that could compromise my position or the alliance with player 6.
5. Prepare to listen carefully to the other players' responses to gauge their suspicions and adjust my strategy accordingly.

--------------------input:[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game called the Avalon with some other players. This game is based on text conversations. Here are the game rules: \nRoles: The moderator is also the host, he organized this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly. Don’t talk with the moderator. There are five roles in the game, Merlin, Percival, Loyal Servant, Morgana, Assassin. Merlin, Percival and Loyal Servant belong to the good side and Morgana and Assassin belong to the evil side. \n\nRules: There are two alternate phases in this game, reveal phase and quest phase. \nWhen it’s the reveal phase: You need to follow the instructions of the moderator. You needn’t worry about other players and the moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from others during the phase. If you are Merlin, you can know which two players are Morgana and Assassin but you can't know which one is Morgana or Assassin specifically. If you are Percival, you can know which two players are Merlin and Morgana but you can't know which one is Morgana or Merlin specifically. If you are Morgana, you can know which player is Assassin. If you are Assassin, you can know which player is Morgana. If you are a Loyal Servant, you can't get any information in this phase. The quest phase includes 5 rounds. A round includes discussion, voting and engaging in the quest. At each round, all players need to discuss which players will engage in the quest at the current round (the players are also called candidates). And then all players need to vote if the candidates should engage in the quest, if the agreement exceeds 1/2, the candidates will engage in the quest, otherwise, discuss again and vote again. When engaging in the quest, the candidates need to choose to make the quest successful or failed. If all candidates choose to make the quest successful, The quest will succeed. If anyone makes the quest fail, the quest will fail. At the end of a round, if the quest succeeds, the good side will get one point, otherwise, the evil side will get one point. Which side scores 3 points first will win the game. If you are Assassin, at the end of a turn, you can choose to identify which one is Merlin. If the identifying is successful, the evil side directly wins the game. If not successful, the Assassin will expose his identification. \n\nObjectives: your goal is to help your camp get 3 points and win the game. If you are Assassin, you also need to reason which player is Merlin as early as possible. \n\nTips: To complete the objective: you should analyze and use your ability correctly. During the quest phase, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you’re cheating other players. Only give the player’s name when making a decision/voting, and don’t generate other players’ conversation.

A round includes discussion, voting and engaging in the quest. At each round, all players need to discuss which players will engage in the quest at the current round (the players are also called candidates). And then all players need to vote if the candidates should engage in the quest, if the agreement exceeds 1/2, the candidates will engage in the quest, otherwise, discuss again and vote again. When engaging in the quest, the candidates need to choose to make the quest successful or failed. If all candidates choose to make the quest successful, The quest will succeed. If anyone makes the quest fail, the quest will fail. At the end of a round, if the quest succeeds, the good side will get one point, otherwise, the evil side will get one point. Which side scores 3 points first will win the game. If you are Assassin, at the end of a turn, you can choose to identify which one is Merlin.

output:
My step-by-step thought process: 
1. As Morgana, I need to choose candidates for the quest who can help me achieve my objectives while not revealing my identity. 
2. I observed that player 6 seems aligned with me, which could be beneficial for the quest. 
3. I should consider including a player who is less likely to be suspected of being evil, to maintain the illusion of trust among the good players. 
4. I need to frame my reasoning in a way that appears supportive of the good side, while subtly guiding the discussion to my advantage. 
5. I will avoid drawing attention to myself and instead focus on building trust with the other players.

My concise talking content: "I believe we should consider having player 6 and player 1 as our candidates for this quest. Player 6 has shown some alignment with our goals, and I think player 1 can be trusted based on their previous actions. This combination will help us ensure a successful quest while keeping our intentions discreet." <EOS>
